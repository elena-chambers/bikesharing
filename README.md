## Summary
Bikesharing is most popular in areas with heavy traffic but diminish farther out from cetral areas. The majority of customers are male and are participating in the bikeshare supscription versus a one time pass. Bikes are most frequently checked out during common commuting hours. 
Further analysis could benefit by including visulzations that show:
- rental frequncy by user (ie, how many times a single user rents a bike in a given timeframe) would be useful to determine how many people rely on bikeshare services to get to and from work.
- trip duration by gender by age to see how user ages impact the lenth of rental and what ages we start to see declines in duration. This would help direct marketing to demographics that would use bikes the longest
